# Analysis on Hotel Booking 

### Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation of Exploratory Data Analysis on Hotel Booking investigates cancellations, their underlying patterns, suggested measures that can be implemented to reduce cancellations and secure solid revenue.

The project covers booking information for a city hotel and resort hotel including information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults and children.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this exploratory data analysis was obtained from Kaggle [Download here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mojtaba142/hotel-booking?rvi=1)

### Tools Used

For data cleaning project, the following tools and libraries were used:
 1. **Python** for data cleaning tasks.
 2. **Pandas** was instrumental in data manipulation, cleaning and handling missing values.
 3. **Numpy** was utilized for mathematical operations and array handling during the cleaning process.
 4. **Jupyter Notebooks** provided an interactive environment for code development, exploration and documentation.

### Data Cleaning Process

The data cleaning process involved the following steps:

1.**Data Understanding** - The dataset was thoroughly examined to understand the structure, columns and their meanings by doing research that helped me gain an understanding of what all the columns represented.

2.**Data Exploration** - Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to gain insights into the data, identify patterns and uncover anomalities.

3.**Handling missing values** - Columns that had less null values were filled with 0, while the columns that had alot of missing values were deleted.

4.**Handling duplicate values** - Duplicate values in the dataset were deleted to prevent data redundacy and also bias and inaccuracies of the dataset.

5.**Validation and quality checks** - The cleaned dataset underwent rigorous validation to ensure the quality, accuracy and integrity of the data.
