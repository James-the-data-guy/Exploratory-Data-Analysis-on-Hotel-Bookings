# Analysis on Hotel Booking 

### Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation of Exploratory Data Analysis on Hotel Booking investigates cancellations, their underlying patterns, suggested measures that can be implemented to reduce cancellations and secure solid revenue.

The project covers booking information for a city hotel and resort hotel including information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults and children.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this exploratory data analysis was obtained from Kaggle [Download here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mojtaba142/hotel-booking?rvi=1)

### Tools Used

For data cleaning project, the following tools and libraries were used:
 1. **Python** for data cleaning tasks.
 2. **Pandas** was instrumental in data manipulation, cleaning and handling missing values.
 3. **Numpy** was utilized for mathematical operations and array handling during the cleaning process.
 4. **Jupyter Notebooks** provided an interactive environment for code development, exploration and documentation.

### Data Cleaning Process

The data cleaning process involved the following steps:

1.**Data Understanding** - The dataset was thoroughly examined to understand the structure, columns and their meanings by doing research that helped me gain an understanding of what all the columns represented.

2.**Data Exploration** - Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to gain insights into the data, identify patterns and uncover anomalities.

3.**Handling missing values** - Columns that had less null values were filled with 0, while the columns that had alot of missing values were deleted.

4.**Handling duplicate values** - Duplicate values in the dataset were deleted to prevent data redundacy and also bias and inaccuracies of the dataset.

5.**Validation and quality checks** - The cleaned dataset underwent rigorous validation to ensure the quality, accuracy and integrity of the data.

### Business Questions to answer

 1. Which type of hotel is most preffered by the guests?
 2. What is the hotel booking cancellation?
 3. What type of meal is most preffered by guests?
 4. Which year had the most bookings?
 5. Which month had the most bookings in each hotel type?
 6. Which country do most of guests come from?
 7. Which distribution channel is most used in booking?
 8. Which room type is most preffered by guests?
 9. Which room type is most assigned?
 10. Top 5 agents in terms of most bookings?
 11. What is the percentage of repeated guests?
 12. Which customer type has the most booking?
 13. Which market segment has the most booking?
 14. Which deposite type is most preffered?
 15. Which hotel have most repeated guests?
 16. What is the adr across different months?
 17. Which distibution channel has the highest adr?

### Solution to Business Objective

 1. Resort hotel is most preffered so management can offer discounts in city hotel to increase bookings.
 2. Around 27.52% of bookings are cancelled so hotels can offer layality discount if guests don't cancel their bookings.
 3. Bed and breakfast is the most preffered meal, so it should be prepared early and get served on time.
 4. Room type A is most preffered by guests, so hotel should increase the number of room type A.
 5. Number of repeated guests is low that indicates there is something guests don't like which needs to fixed inorder to increase number of repeated guests.
 6. Majority number of guests came from Portugal, so the management should market in that country inorder to have many more guests. 

### Conclusion

Inorder to achieve the business objective, I would suggest the client to make the price dynamic, introduce offers and packages to attract new customers. To retain the exitisting customers and ensure their repetition the client must introduce loyalty points program which can be redeemed by the customers in their next bookings. Amenities such as parking spaces, kids corner, free internet connection can be provided to increase the number of bookings.
